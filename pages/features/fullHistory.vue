        The Full Conversations' History feature allows users to access a comprehensive record of all interactions within a chat platform.

        In real-world usage, the ability to reference previous chats can significantly reduce response times and improve the quality of support provided. For instance, if a customer reaches out with a recurring issue, agents can quickly pull up the relevant conversation history to understand the context and offer a more informed solution. This not only fosters a sense of continuity for the customer but also builds trust and loyalty towards the brand.
