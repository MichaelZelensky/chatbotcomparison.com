        The significance of Salesforce integration lies in its ability to provide a unified view of customer interactions. This means that sales and support teams can access real-time information about customer inquiries, purchase history, and preferences, leading to more personalized service. In a competitive market, the ability to respond quickly and effectively to customer needs can be a game-changer, fostering loyalty and driving sales.
