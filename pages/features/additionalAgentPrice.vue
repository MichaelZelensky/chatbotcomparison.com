        Having the option to add additional agents is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction. With more agents available, response times can be significantly reduced, leading to quicker resolutions of customer issues. This not only enhances the customer experience but also helps in building brand loyalty. In a competitive market, the ability to respond promptly and effectively can be a key differentiator for businesses.

        Real-world usage of this feature means that companies can scale their support teams dynamically. For instance, during peak shopping seasons or product launches, businesses can temporarily increase their agent count to handle the influx of inquiries. This adaptability not only optimizes operational efficiency but also ensures that customers feel valued and heard, which is essential for long-term success.
