        This feature matters because it helps businesses balance workload and customer service quality. When customers know when they can expect responses, they are less likely to feel frustrated or neglected. Additionally, it allows support teams to manage their time effectively, reducing burnout and improving overall morale. In a world where instant communication is the norm, having structured working hours can set a business apart as professional and reliable.

        In real-world usage, the Working Hours Settings feature can significantly impact customer interactions. For instance, a business that operates from 9 AM to 5 PM can set its chat support to reflect these hours, ensuring that customers receive timely responses. This not only fosters trust but also allows businesses to prepare for peak times, ensuring that they have adequate staffing during busy periods. Overall, this feature is a vital component of a well-organized customer service strategy.
