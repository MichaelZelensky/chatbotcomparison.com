        ChatBot.com, by contrast, focuses primarily on chatbot automation rather than live chat. Pricing starts at $52 per month and can reach $424 per month, with limits based on factors such as the number of chats, active chatbots, and training history. The platform emphasizes a visual drag-and-drop builder, structured conversational flows, and AI features powered by knowledge sources, including AI-assisted bot creation, model training, and multilingual support. These tools are designed for controlled, rule-based automation rather than fully autonomous AI conversations. ChatBot.com also provides APIs, webhooks, and SDKs for integration, as well as an Enterprise plan with advanced security, service-level agreements, and custom onboarding.
