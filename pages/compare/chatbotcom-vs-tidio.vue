        Tidio offers a flexible pricing structure that starts with a free plan, which includes up to 10 agents and 50 billable conversations per month. Its paid plans are structured to scale with business growth, making it accessible to small teams while still supporting more advanced requirements as usage increases. ChatBot.com, by contrast, uses a fixed tiered pricing model, starting at $52 per month for its Starter plan, which includes one active chatbot and up to 12,000 chats per year. This approach emphasizes predictable usage limits and a clearly defined feature set from the outset.

        From a features perspective, Tidio provides a broad toolkit that combines AI-assisted conversations, live chat widgets, and integrations with popular platforms such as WordPress and Shopify. It also includes analytics and CRM-related features that can support deeper insight into customer interactions. ChatBot.com places stronger emphasis on structured chatbot creation and management, offering a visual drag-and-drop builder, automatic bot building, and tools designed to simplify chatbot setup without requiring extensive technical knowledge. Both platforms support multilingual AI capabilities, though they differ in how strongly they focus on analytics versus structured automation workflows.
