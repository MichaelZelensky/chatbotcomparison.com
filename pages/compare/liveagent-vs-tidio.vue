      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Tidio offers a range of pricing plans starting with a free tier that includes 10 agents and limited features, while LiveAgent operates on a per-agent pricing model at $19 per agent. Tidio's free plan allows for 50 billable conversations per month, whereas LiveAgent's pricing is based on the number of agents, making it potentially more expensive for larger teams.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In terms of features, Tidio provides a comprehensive suite including chat widgets, contact forms, and integrations with platforms like Shopify and WordPress. It also includes AI capabilities with its Copilot feature. LiveAgent, on the other hand, focuses on providing a robust ticketing system, live chat, and a universal inbox, which can be beneficial for businesses that require extensive customer support management.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Tidio's plans are designed for scalability, allowing users to upgrade as their needs grow, with advanced analytics and automation features available in higher tiers. LiveAgent's structure is more rigid, as additional costs accrue with each new agent added, which could lead to higher expenses for larger organizations. However, LiveAgent's 30-day free trial allows businesses to test its features extensively before committing.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion">
      Choose Tidio if you are looking for a cost-effective solution with a free plan and strong automation features, especially for small to medium-sized businesses. Opt for LiveAgent if you need a more traditional customer support system with a focus on ticketing and agent management, particularly if your team is larger and can benefit from its comprehensive features.
