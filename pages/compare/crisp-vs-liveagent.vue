        Crisp offers a variety of pricing plans starting from a free tier that includes essential features for up to 2 agents, while LiveAgent operates on a per-agent pricing model at $19 per agent. Crisp's free plan allows for unlimited conversations and includes features like a chat widget, contact form, and mobile apps, making it suitable for small businesses or startups. In contrast, LiveAgent's pricing can add up quickly as businesses scale, but it provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing customer interactions across multiple channels.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In terms of features, Crisp stands out with its extensive capabilities in its higher-tier plans, such as AI usage, CRM integrations, and advanced analytics. The Essentials plan at $95 offers up to 10 agents and includes features like live translation and proactive messaging. LiveAgent, while more limited in its feature set, excels in providing a robust universal inbox and hybrid ticket stream, which can be beneficial for teams looking to streamline their customer support processes.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Crisp's user interface is designed for ease of use, making it accessible for teams without extensive technical expertise. Its mobile and desktop apps enhance accessibility for support agents on the go. LiveAgent, on the other hand, offers a more traditional support ticketing system that may appeal to larger organizations with established workflows. The choice between the two may depend on whether a business prioritizes a modern chat experience or a comprehensive ticketing solution.
