      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Crisp offers a flexible pricing structure that starts with a free plan, which includes essential features for up to two agents, unlimited conversations, a chat widget, contact forms, and mobile and desktop apps. This makes it accessible for startups and small businesses that want to introduce live chat and basic customer support without upfront costs. LiveAgent, in contrast, follows a per-agent pricing model starting at $19 per agent per month. While this can scale in cost as teams grow, it provides a more traditional and comprehensive toolset for managing customer interactions across multiple channels.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        From a features perspective, Crisp emphasizes a modern, chat-centric support experience. Its higher-tier plans introduce AI usage, CRM integrations, advanced analytics, live translation, and proactive messaging, allowing teams to build richer customer engagement workflows as they scale. LiveAgent focuses more strongly on structured support operations, offering a universal inbox, hybrid ticket stream, and tools designed to centralize communication from live chat, email, and other channels. These capabilities can be particularly useful for teams that rely on ticket-based workflows and need clear organization and routing of customer requests.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In terms of usability and workflow, Crisp is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, making it approachable for teams without deep technical expertise. Its emphasis on real-time chat and intuitive interfaces supports fast adoption and flexible support setups. LiveAgent, on the other hand, aligns more closely with established customer support processes, where ticketing, categorization, and internal workflows play a central role. This makes it appealing to larger teams or organizations that require more formalized support management.
      </p>

    <p class="conclusion">
      Overall, the choice between Crisp and LiveAgent depends on support strategy and team structure. Crisp is well suited for small to medium-sized businesses that want a feature-rich chat solution with flexible pricing and a strong free tier. LiveAgent is better aligned with organizations that prioritize robust ticketing, structured workflows, and are comfortable with a per-agent pricing model as their support team expands.
