        When it comes to features, Zendesk provides advanced capabilities such as multilingual support, custom dashboards, and extensive analytics tools in its higher-tier plans. LiveAgent, on the other hand, focuses on providing a comprehensive live chat experience with features like proactive chat, live typing, and a universal inbox, which consolidates all customer interactions. This makes LiveAgent particularly appealing for businesses that prioritize real-time customer engagement.

        Both platforms offer free trials, with Zendesk providing a 14-day trial across all plans, while LiveAgent offers a longer 30-day trial. This extended trial period for LiveAgent allows potential users to explore its features more thoroughly before making a commitment. Additionally, Zendesk's higher-tier plans come with advanced AI capabilities, which may be attractive for larger enterprises looking for sophisticated automation.
