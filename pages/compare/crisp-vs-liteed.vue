        Crisp offers a range of plans starting from a free tier that includes 2 agents and 100 customer profiles, while Liteed provides a free beta version with unlimited chats but only 1 agent. Crisp's paid plans, such as the Mini at $45 and Essentials at $95, allow for more agents and customer profiles, making it suitable for growing businesses. In contrast, Liteed's free beta is ideal for startups looking to test chatbot functionalities without upfront costs.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        When it comes to features, Crisp boasts advanced functionalities like AI usage, proactive messaging, and extensive CRM integrations, especially in its higher-tier plans. Liteed, on the other hand, emphasizes unlimited AI usage and multilingual capabilities, making it a strong contender for businesses that require diverse language support. Both platforms offer cloud-based solutions with mobile and desktop apps, ensuring accessibility for teams on the go.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Pricing is a significant differentiator; Crisp's plans range from free to $295 for larger teams, while Liteed remains free during its beta phase. This makes Liteed an attractive option for businesses with limited budgets or those just starting out. However, Crisp's structured pricing and feature-rich plans may appeal to established businesses looking for comprehensive customer support tools.
