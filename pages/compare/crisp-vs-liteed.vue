        Crisp offers a tiered pricing structure that starts with a free plan, which includes two agents and a limited number of customer profiles, making it suitable for small teams getting started with live chat and basic support. Its paid plans, such as Mini at $45 per month and Essentials at $95 per month, expand agent limits, customer profiles, and feature access, positioning Crisp as a scalable solution for growing and established businesses. Liteed, by contrast, currently provides a free beta plan with unlimited chats and AI usage but is limited to a single agent, making it particularly attractive for startups or early-stage teams that want to experiment with chatbot functionality without upfront costs.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        From a feature standpoint, Crisp focuses on combining live chat, AI assistance, and customer relationship management into a unified platform. Higher-tier plans include capabilities such as proactive messaging, deeper CRM integrations, and broader automation tools designed to support structured customer engagement across multiple touchpoints. Liteed places stronger emphasis on chatbot-centric functionality, highlighting unlimited AI usage and multilingual support, which can be valuable for businesses operating in multiple languages or testing conversational AI use cases. Both platforms are cloud-based and offer mobile and desktop applications, allowing teams to stay connected and manage conversations across devices.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Pricing represents a key difference between the two solutions. Crisp’s plans scale from free up to higher-priced tiers intended for larger teams and more advanced support requirements, reflecting its focus on long-term scalability and feature depth. Liteed’s free beta model lowers the barrier to entry and reduces financial risk, making it a practical option for businesses with limited budgets or those still validating their chatbot strategy.
      </p>

    <p class="conclusion">
      Ultimately, Crisp is more aligned with organizations seeking a comprehensive, scalable customer support platform, while Liteed is better suited for teams looking for a low-cost way to adopt and test AI-powered chatbot capabilities during early stages.
