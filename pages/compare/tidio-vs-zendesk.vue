      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Tidio offers a range of pricing plans starting from a free tier, making it accessible for small businesses. The free plan includes 10 agents and allows for 50 billable conversations per month. In contrast, Zendesk's lowest plan, Suite Team, starts at $55 per month and includes essential AI agents but does not offer a free tier. This makes Tidio a more budget-friendly option for startups and small businesses looking to manage customer interactions without upfront costs.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In terms of features, Tidio provides a robust set of tools including chat widgets, email integration, and automation capabilities. It also supports various platforms like WordPress and Shopify. Zendesk, on the other hand, offers advanced features such as custom dashboards and API analytics in its higher-tier plans, which can be beneficial for larger organizations needing detailed insights and customization. However, these features come at a higher price point.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        When it comes to use cases, Tidio is ideal for businesses that require quick setup and straightforward customer engagement tools. Its free plan is particularly attractive for those just starting out. Zendesk, with its more comprehensive suite of tools, is better suited for medium to large enterprises that need advanced support capabilities and are willing to invest more for enhanced features and scalability.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="conclusion">
      Choose Tidio if you are a small business or startup looking for an affordable and easy-to-use customer support solution. Opt for Zendesk if you are part of a larger organization that requires advanced features and customization options to manage complex customer interactions effectively.
