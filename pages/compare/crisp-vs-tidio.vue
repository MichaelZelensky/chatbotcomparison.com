        Crisp offers a range of pricing plans starting from a free tier that includes 2 agents and 100 customer profiles, while Tidio also has a free plan but allows for 10 agents and 50 billable conversations per month. Crisp's paid plans begin at $45 for 4 agents and 5000 customer profiles, whereas Tidio's starter plan is priced at $29 for 10 agents and 100 billable conversations. This makes Tidio a more cost-effective option for businesses needing more agents on a budget.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In terms of features, Crisp provides extensive functionalities such as unlimited conversations, live typing, and advanced CRM capabilities in its higher tiers. Tidio, on the other hand, includes AI-assisted conversations and automation features, but its advanced analytics and customization options are more limited compared to Crisp's offerings. For businesses that prioritize AI integration and automation, Tidio may be the better choice.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Crisp is particularly suitable for larger teams and businesses that require robust CRM features and extensive customization options. In contrast, Tidio is ideal for small to medium-sized businesses looking for an affordable solution with essential chat functionalities and AI support.
