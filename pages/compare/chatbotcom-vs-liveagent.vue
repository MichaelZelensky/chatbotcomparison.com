        ChatBot.com uses a fixed, tiered pricing structure starting at $52 per month for its Starter plan, which includes a chat widget, active chatbots, and access to a templates library. Higher-tier plans unlock more advanced automation features, AI model training, and multilingual support, making the platform suitable for businesses that manage larger chat volumes and want to incorporate automated support elements into their workflows. LiveAgent, on the other hand, operates on a per-agent pricing model starting at $19 per agent per month, which can be more cost-effective for smaller teams that rely primarily on human agents rather than automated workflows.

        From a functionality perspective, ChatBot.com focuses on AI-driven automation and structured chatbot experiences. It offers tools such as a visual builder, automatic bot creation, and a wide range of integrations with platforms like Shopify and WordPress. LiveAgent places a stronger emphasis on real-time communication and ticket management, providing features such as proactive live chat, website monitoring, and a universal inbox for handling customer inquiries across multiple channels. This makes LiveAgent particularly appealing to businesses that prioritize immediate human interaction and centralized ticket-based support.
