      <p class="body-paragraph">
        ChatBot.com offers a tiered pricing structure starting at $52 per month for its Starter plan, which includes a visual builder, AI assistance, and support for multiple platforms such as WordPress and Shopify. Zendesk’s pricing begins at $55 per month for its Suite Team plan, which provides core customer support features along with basic AI capabilities and integrations across multiple messaging channels. While both platforms offer a 14-day free trial, their pricing reflects different priorities: ChatBot.com focuses on chatbot functionality from the entry level, whereas Zendesk positions chatbots as part of a broader support ecosystem.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        From a feature perspective, ChatBot.com is centered around chatbot creation and automation. Higher-tier plans support unlimited active chatbots, automatic bot building, and multilingual AI, allowing teams to manage structured conversational flows and higher chat volumes within defined limits. Zendesk, by contrast, emphasizes integration with wider customer support operations. Its chatbot and AI tools are designed to work alongside ticketing, help desk workflows, and multi-channel communication, with more advanced customization and automation becoming available on higher-tier plans.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In terms of use cases, ChatBot.com is commonly adopted by organizations that want to deploy chatbots at scale and manage a high volume of automated conversations within a dedicated chatbot platform. Zendesk is more often chosen by companies that prioritize customer relationship management and require a unified system covering chat, email, phone support, and internal workflows. Both platforms integrate with tools such as Slack and Zapier, which helps them fit into existing business processes.
      </p>

    <p class="conclusion">
      Overall, the choice between these two platforms depends on scope and priorities. ChatBot.com aligns with teams looking for a feature-rich chatbot solution with clear usage limits and strong automation tools, while Zendesk is better suited for organizations seeking a comprehensive customer support system where chatbots are one component of a larger, multi-channel service strategy.
